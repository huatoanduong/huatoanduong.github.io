# Dương Hứa Toàn (Tony)

## Expert Software Developer

Experienced IT professional with 15+ years in the industry, primarily in dynamic startup environments. Proven track record of delivering end-to-end solutions across the full software development lifecycle - including system analysis, architecture design, full-stack development, team leadership, and production deployment.

Having spent 90% of my career in startups, I thrive in fast-paced, high-demand environments that require adaptability, self-learning, and end-to-end ownership. I’m highly proficient in designing scalable software architectures and cloud-native solutions, and I'm quick to adopt new technologies when needed. The nature of startup work has also forged my ability to wear multiple hats—whether it's coding, architecting, or managing cross-functional teams—with a focus on delivering real value to customers.
