# DÆ°Æ¡ng Há»©a ToÃ n (Tony)

## Expert Software Developer

Experienced IT professional with 15+ years in the industry, primarily in dynamic startup environments. Proven track record of delivering end-to-end solutions across the full software development lifecycle - including system analysis, architecture design, full-stack development, team leadership, and production deployment.

Having spent 90% of my career in startups, I thrive in fast-paced, high-demand environments that require adaptability, self-learning, and end-to-end ownership. Iâ€™m highly proficient in designing scalable software architectures and cloud-native solutions, and I'm quick to adopt new technologies when needed. The nature of startup work has also forged my ability to wear multiple hatsâ€”whether it's coding, architecting, or managing cross-functional teamsâ€”with a focus on delivering real value to customers.
